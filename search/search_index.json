I was instantly obsessed. </p> <p>Why, you might ask? Well, I've also been a bit of a tech geek. As a 90s kid, I've indulged in all the technological eras: from the PC revolution to the Gen AI boom. </p> <p>My first real interaction with a computer was when I was about 7. I vividly remember the rush I felt dragging the cursor to draw a circle in Microsoft Paint. Years later, I felt a similar rush bootstrapping a website using HTML and CSS in Notepad. </p> <p>You see, technical writing hits the sweet spot for me. It combines my love for writing with my ever-growing fascination with technology. </p> <p>To pivot from copywriting, I honed my technical skills and secured my first tech writer role at Bloomreach. It was a challenge but a savory one!</p> <p>And here I am, writing a blog on technical writing.

After reading the documentation, the user should feel confident performing the task. Confusing the users only results in frustration and angry support tickets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Concise: Snip the verbose and keep the docs short wherever possible. Most users scan instead of reading. Focus on brevity and scannability of the documentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consistent: Make sure that you're using similar terminology across your docs. This reduces the cognitive load on users to decide/understand multiple different terms that mean the same thing. </p> </li> <li> <p>Complete: Good documentation is exhaustive. It doesn't miss out on the details that the users need to know to successfully complete the tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Contextual: Know your audience inside out and write in their lingo. Writing for a marketing audience is widely different from writing for an IT audience.
