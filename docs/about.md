# Welcome to Lemme Doc It
After dabbling in the world of technical writing for some time, I decided to pen down my thoughts. 

In this space, you'll find my opinion pieces and personal learnings. Read on if you're interested in knowing me. 

## Who am I
Hi there! My name is Khushi Sharma. I've been a technical writer for the past three wonderful years at Bloomreach. 

## Where I live 
I live in Slovenia, but I'm originally from Delhi, India. How I landed here is a whole different legend that needs its own storytime. 

*Spoiler: It was for❤️*

## What I love 
I've been in love with writing for as long as I can remember. It began with writing alliterative romantic poems under a secret pen name. This love eventually translated into work. 

## Finding the right writing fit
I freelanced as a writer during college. I also volunteered at a local non-profit to teach English. 

After that, I had a brief stint at copywriting. This was an exploratory phase where I wanted to know where I fit in as a writer. Clearly, it wasn't my calling. 

## Discovering technical writing 
It was by sheer chance that I discovered technical writing while reading a tech blog. I was instantly obsessed. 

Why, you might ask? Well, I've also been a bit of a tech geek. As a 90s kid, I've indulged in all the technological eras: from the PC revolution to the Gen AI boom. 

My first real interaction with a computer was when I was about 7. I vividly remember the rush I felt dragging the cursor to draw a circle in Microsoft Paint. 

Years later, I felt a similar rush bootstrapping a website using HTML and CSS in Notepad. 

You see, technical writing hits the sweet spot for me. It combines my love for writing with my ever-growing fascination with technology. 

To pivot from copywriting, I honed my technical skills and secured my first tech writer role at Bloomreach. It was a challenge but a savory one!

And here I am, writing a blog on technical writing. Life comes full circle, doesn't it :)
